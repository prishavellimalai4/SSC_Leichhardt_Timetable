## üîß Technical Overview

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no frameworks required
- **Data Sources**: JSON files (primary) with XML fallback support
- **API Integration**: Connects to Sentral REST API for live data
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for scheduled data updates
- **Deployment**: Static files - works on any web server or GitHub Pages

### Recent Improvements (v2.1)

- **Fixed GitHub Actions conflicts**: Workflows now handle git merge conflicts automatically
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better fallback mechanisms for data loading
- **Improved scheduling**: Optimized LISS updates during school hours only
- **Better logging**: Comprehensive debug information for troubleshooting
- **Performance optimizations**: Faster data loading and processing

### Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all modern versions)
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- ‚úÖ Kiosk mode and embedded iframe support

### System Requirements

- **Server**: Any web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS) or static hosting
- **Client**: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- **API (Optional)**: Sentral student management system with REST API access

## üìä Data Integration

The kiosk supports multiple data sources for maximum reliability:

1. **Live API Data**: Direct integration with Sentral REST API
2. **Cached JSON**: Local files generated from API calls
3. **Static XML**: Fallback files downloaded from Sentral web interface
4. **Sample Data**: Built-in demonstration data for testing

This multi-tier approach ensures the kiosk always displays useful information, even during network outages or API maintenance.
